# Chapter 1: Basic Concepts

## 1.2 state, state space, action

## 1.3 state transition
State transition can be determined or stochastic.

## 1.4 policy
Policy can be ditermined or stochastic.

## 1.5 reward
Reward can be ditermined or stochastic.

## 1.6 trajecotry, return, episode
Return is immediate reward plus future reward, namely total reward or cumulative reward.<br>
For discount rate $\gamma \in (0,1)$ , we have discounted return.<br>
An episodic task can be converted into a continuing task if we make changes on terminal state.
